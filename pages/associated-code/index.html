<p>Holger's initial MATLAB + Soundmexpro script initially worked well to run the audio-video rig. The code began to raise issues on my laptop over time however. SoundmexPro is an audio-interface plugin which needs a dongle to run. However, thanks to my laptop's USB ports (and perhaps one too many rough field nights) - the dongle never sat properly, and even checking audio files while the code was running would trigger an error.</p>
<p>At some point I finally got bugged with the finickiness of having a dongle to run data collection. Why not get rid of the dongle completely? And thus began my foray into the Python <code>sounddevice</code> package. <code>fieldrecorder</code> is the result - a bit of janky code I patched together. It is far from beautiful, but gets the job done - and may perhaps be of interest for anyone looking to develop an ASIO based input-output reactive system! There are at least two version of the code - one which triggers recordings automatically once a threshold is crossed, and one which requires a user to press a keyboard button.</p>
<p>Check out <code>fieldrecorder</code> on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/thejasvibr/fieldrecorder">this link</a> .</p>

<p><code>beamshapes</code> started out as an attempt to realistically model sound radiation in bat calls. There is <cite>one</cite> model used a lot - and that assumes front-back symmetry in sound radiation. A lot of studies also only study what happens in <cite>front</cite> of the animal. <code>beamshapes</code> is an attempt to show the community that there are other sound radiation models out there that truly describe all-round sound radiation. The package implements multiple sound radiation models - which can be used for predicting acoustic detections or to estimate source model parameters.</p>
